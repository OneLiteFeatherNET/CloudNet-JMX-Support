# CloudNet v4 | JMX Support
This CloudNet module enables the possibility to track GC, memory and more via Java JMX.

## Focus
The purpose of these modules is to improve monitoring in the context of CloudNet in accordance with the JMX standard. It is not intended to create functionalities in the game.

## Motivation

As we have a very high standard and need for monitoring. And there is currently no easy way to create ports dynamically in JVM arguments, so this module has been dropped from the OneLiteFeather
